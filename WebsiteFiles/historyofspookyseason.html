    <h2> Origins of Spooky Season </h2>
    <p>
      Spooky Season has a long and illustrious history. From its early origins as a celtic holiday, to today's commercialized candy-filled
      Halloween, there is much more to it than one might think.
      <h4 class="history">Samhain</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Samhain is a fascinating Gaelic holiday that is believed to have been observed by Pagans as far back as neolithic times!
          It is a celebration of the end of the harvest season and the beginning of the dark winter season. The Gaelic would offer sacrifices
          to fairies, spirits, and their dead ancestors in hopes of being granted survival through the winter. They would light bonfires and dress
          as ghosts to disguise themselves from the fairies. People often went door to door in these costumes and recited poetry in exchange for
          food! Sounds familiar?
        </p>
     <h4 class="history">All Saints' Day</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">
          All Saint's Day, also known as All Hallow's Day is a Christian festival celebrating, believe it or not, all the saints. It is a celebration
          observed on November 1st where everyone has a large feast.
          All Saint's Day is still a national holiday in many countries and basically is a day on which people thank god for the life and death of Saints.
          It is believed that All Saints Day was created by Pope Gregory III to either coincide with or replace Samhain. The night before All Saint's Day is
          All Hallow's Eve or Hallowe'en. See where this is going? The holiday was brought to America by Puritans and other colonists
          living in Maryland and other southern colonies.

    <h2> Modern Day Spooky Season </h2>

       <h4 class="history">Halloween</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Since the 1600s, Halloween has slowly changed and evolved into the holiday we all know and love. Kids go door to door in costume
          looking for candy. Adults sit by their doors highly annoyed as they wait for kids to ring their doorball at some ungodly hour.
          There are classic Halloween songs and movies known by everyone, and certain images like jack-o'-lanterns and candy corn are universal
          symbols that evoke the idea of Halloween.
        </p>
       <h4 class="history">Spooky Season Today</h4>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Urban Dictionary, a top authority on Spooky Season, defines "Spooky Season" as "Fall time of year around Halloween where everyone
      gets spooky vibes" (MC CROWE, 2018). This is a very strong way of putting it. In today's modern world, people observe the weeks leading
      up to Halloween by changing their instagram tags to encorporate the word "spooky" and changing profile pictures to include some Halloween-themed imagery.
      They may and do play Monster Mash at unoppurtune and often inappropriate times without warning or explanation. The festivities only cease when the calender turns
      to November. At which point it life becomes one slow grind until Thanksgiving.
